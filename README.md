Mix of cryptography, database wrappers and utilities

Some interesting problems I have solved for my personal use at home or at events.

1) There are lots of tools to migrate databases, but if you were given just 2 hours, a open source SQL workbench and Python what could you produce quickly?
2) Python Pandas is a awesome library for data analytics and for processing data using DataFrames. For awhile the Pandas SQL extention did not support bulk inserts.
3) Using SQLAlchemy and Pandas with wrapper operations is nice when working with many database systems and wanting to produce something quickly.
4) Handy AES encryption, decryption tool is always fun especially when given random seecurity requirements as part of a hackathon.
5) Spinning up open source Hadoop in the cloud and then transfering files over programatically and quiclkly or writing Pandas DataFrames to HDFS.
6) Processing pairs of words for anagram detection
